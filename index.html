		<aside class='notes'> I stumbled upon them with my own research and chose to study at the Universit of Victoria because of my supervisor's research connections to quasicrystals.  I will give a broad view of the story in this talk and if you're interested in how my research connects feel free to ping me.  Quasicrystals were discovered because of the interplay between the fields of chemistry, mathematics and physics.    And what really drew me to them, is how their existence created a paradigm shift in all three fields, it opened people’s eyes and forced them to consider something they previously thought was impossible. If you could choose for you to get one thing out of this talk, it's that both science and mathematics are alive and ever-changing and ever-updating fields.  A lot of poeple think that mathematics is full of static truths, but in fact this is not really the case.  Definitions are updated, information consolidated and made more abstract the field is ever calibrating to new information.</aside>

    <h3> Crystallography </h3>
<a href=https://www.kqed.org/science/1536955/identical-snowflakes-scientist-ruins-winter-for-everyone-deep-look> <img src="public/images/snowflake.gif"  height="75%" width="75%" align='center'> </a> 

    <aside class ='notes'> We begin with Chemistry and the study of crystals.  
		The story of crystallography dates back to Johannes Kepler in 1611, when he was too poor to purchase a gift, so he wrote an essay on snowflakes to give to his friend for Christmas.  Apparently, he had noticed a snowflake on the lapel of his coat in Prague, and was curious about its geometry. It is believed that from this work, crystallography began: the exploration of how the geometric shapes of crystals can be explained in terms of the structure of their constituent particles.
		Crystallography asks questions about the structure of crystals and how they are formed. Questions like why do snowflakes have six arms?

     This animation shows the structure of a snowflake, molecules fitting together in the shape of a hexagonal ring with bonds forming between hydrogen of one molecule and the oxygen of another molecule.  As more molecules join the growing crystal, they fit into a repeating shape.

		<aside class='notes'> We tend to assume that Nature is efficient and organizes itself for stability.  The hypothesis that crystals are formed by a periodic arrangement of unit cells was the starting
			point for the development of modern crystallography.  Pure crystals were therefore believed to be made up of regularly-repeating components in the structure of a lattice in space. Regularly repeating is a key term here.  For a long time, it was believed that the pattern was periodic.  Note that things are not crystals are glass and silicone.</aside>

	<aside class='notes'> Let's take the example of a salt crystal.  If we consider the front plane of the crystal we can investigate some of the symmetries it posseses.  On the left we have an electron diffraction pattern, this is a tool crystallographers use to identify crystals and determine their symmetries.  The bright spots are called Bragg peak, and indicate places that have defracted from the crystal, this is one way to determine that we have a crystal sample.  For example, for an material such as glass whic his not considered crystaline, the diffraction pattern would look like noise.  In this case, salt has four fold symmetry, this means that if the diffraction pattern were to be rotated by a 1/4 of a turn or 90 degrees about the axis coming into the center of this image, it would look as if it had not been moved at all.  The rotated pattern would fall right on top of the original.And in fact, this can be proved mathematically. </aside>

	<aside class='notes'>  The triangle has a well known interior angle of 60 degrees, we know 60 goes into 360, 6 times and so we see a six fold symmetry about the axis going through each vertex of a triangle. The only possible rotational symmetries of a crystal are 1,2,3, 4 and 6.  We see 6 fold in the tiling by equilateral triangles, 4 fold in the tiling by squares, 3 fold in the tiling of hexagons and 2 fold in tiling by squares as well.  You could also see 2 fold in tilings by parallelograms such as a rhombus or rectangle.  This came to be called the Crystallographic Restriction and was published in chemistry textbooks far and wide. </aside>

		<aside class='notes'>  Shechtman and his team found that the material was made up of aperiodic tilings of two types of rhombuses.  The material was not periodic, but it was ordered.  The material was a solid with a discrete diffraction pattern, but it was not a crystal.  It was a new kind of matter.  They coined the term quasicrystal and described them as models of aperiodic tilings of three dimensional space.  The new theory overturned 200 years of scientific dogma.  By changing the set of assumptions, quasicrstals went against all of the previously accepted mathematical theorems about the symmetry of matter. Symmetries once thought to be forbidden for solids are actually possible for quasicrystals, including solids with axes of ten-fold symmetry.  Even more surprisingly, the two researchers had been working independendently, the only found out about each other when Steinhardt and his student Levine were shown a preprint of the Shechtman team's paper. Paul immediately recognized that Shechtman's discovery could be experimental proof of their still-unpublished quasicrystal theory.  </aside>

	<!-- But other compounds have been produced with other symmetries, like 8-fold or 12-fold symmetries. Besides having their surprising structure, these
materials exhibit strange properties. For instance, even though made of good metals,
they are mostly insulators at low temperature [62, 99]. They are also mechanically hard
and fragile, and they exhibit a superplastic transition at high temperature just below the
melting temperature (see for instance [62] for some of these properties). From the point
of view that is developped in this course, the most interesting aspect of these materials is
that there is no way of treating the aperiodicity as a perturbation of a periodic structure.
Moreover, numerical calculations proved to be extremely hard and they are not powerful
enough to explain most of the properties described above. There is a need for a new
approach and this a typical interesting problem of Mathematical Physics --  Connes>

This also meant that there is a set of tiles the can ONLY tile the plane aperiodically.  Berger created such a tiling using over 20,000 tiles.  He later narrowed the number of tiles to 104.  At this point, the race was on to decrease the number of tiles in a set that can only tile the plane aperiodically.  An amateur mathematician, Ammann, decreased the number to 6!  And finally, a mathematical physicist was able to find an aperiodic tiling with just two tiles, his name is Roger Penrose.  For a long time it was thought this was the minimum set of set of tiles, but last year, in 2023, David Smith, who is not a professional mathematician, found a single tile that can tile the plane aperiodically.

		<aside class='notes'> Paul Steinhardt, an astrophysicist, was inspired by the Penrose tiling and thought that if the plane can be tiled aperiodically why not space as well?   He coined the term quasicrystals and described them as models of aperiodic tilings of three dimensional space.   The new theory overturned 200 years of scientific dogma.   By changing the set of assumptions, quasicrstals went against all of the previously accepted mathematical theorems about the symmetry of matter. Symmetries once thought to be forbidden for solids are actually possible for quasicrystals, including solids with axes of ten-fold symmetry.  Even more surprisingly, the two researchers had been working independendently, the only found out about each other when Steinhardt and his student Levine were shown a preprint of the Shechtman team's paper. Paul immediately recognized that Shechtman's discovery could be experimental proof of their still-unpublished quasicrystal theory. (Show your quasicrystal and paul's book) </aside>

		You would think that with these two papers published that the alloy Dan Shechtman found would be readily accepted and he would be redeemed. But no.  There was a lot of doubt surrounding both papers.  Many theories came about to explain Dan Shechtman's discovery as a mistake.  Each counter-theory that came about was disproved but skepticism remained. Dan Shechtman discvered an man made alloy, but it was believed that nature would never construct such a thing. Paul and Dan spent the next 26 years convincing the scientific community that quasicrystals should be considered as crystals and that a natural quasicrystal was possible.

		<aside class = 'notes' > A little bit before 2009, Paul got lucky.  He was contacted by a researcher from Italy with a sample of a rock from Russia whose diffraction pattern had five fold symmetry.  Paul could not idenfity the origin and formation of the sample.  He sent it to several experts with very disappointing answers, the rock was believed to be slag or waste matter.  He decided to take the matter into his own hands, literally. He and a team travelled to the barren arctic tundra in Russia, on an expedition to find another piece of this rock that could be more clearly identified.  In 2009, his team had found a larger sample in the same place the previous sample had been found.  It was verified that this quasicrystal had five fold symmetry and was found in the natural world within a meteorite that is 4.5 billion years old.  Not only was this an amazing discovery, but this showed that quasicrystals were a stable state of matter.  Nature was happy to tile things aperiodically.   </aside> </section>

			In 1992, the International Union of Crystallography accepted that quasi-periodic materials must exist and altered its definition to the broader "any solid having an essentially discrete diffraction diagram".  In 2011, Dan Shechtman won the Nobel prize in Chemistry for his discovery.  "Dan Shechtman's Nobel prize celebrated not only a fascinating and beautiful discovery, but also dogged determination against the closed-minded ridicule of his peers, including leading scientists of the day."  This story goes to show that sometimes it pays to believe in the impossible. The definition for a crystal is still being debated today.  Quasicrystals are enshrouded in mystery and are actively being studied to this day.</aside>

		<!-- “Quasicrystals are formed in extreme environments that rarely exist on Earth,” said Wallace, who is a geophysicist. “They require a traumatic event with extreme shock, temperature, and pressure. We don’t typically see that, except in something as dramatic as a nuclear explosion.” The thermodynamic/shock conditions under which this quasicrystal formed are roughly comparable to those that formed the natural quasicrystals discovered in the Khatyrka meteorite, which dates back at least hundreds of millions of years and perhaps as far back as the beginning of the solar system. -->
