Not only did they create a parigm shift within the field of crystalography in chemistry but have also had a great impact on astrophysics and mathematics.  I actually came to Victoria in a large part because of the work my supervisor does and its connections to quasicrystals. </aside>

		<aside class ='notes'> The main method of studying these materials is through diffraction, where x-rays are passed through the material, and their atomic arrangement is revealed.   In 1982, in one of these diffraction patterns, he discovered a regular pattern that did not match any periodically repeated structure.  The first impossible thing he noticed is that the pattern had 10 fold symmetry.  This means that if the pattern were to be rotated by a whole number multiple of 1/10 of a turn, it would look as if it had not been moved at all.  The rotated pattern would fall right on top of the original.  For a periodic crystal lattice, 10 fold symmery was forbidden. <br>
		Shechtman's results were so out of the ordinary that, even after he had checked his findings several times, it took two years for his work to get published in a peer-reviewed journal. Once it appeared, he says, "all hell broke loose."

		In spite of all this, he says that the experience was not as traumatic as it sounded. Scientists around the world had quickly replicated Shechtman's discovery and, the field of crystallography was experiencing a paradigm shift and in 1992, the International Union of Crystallography accepted that quasi-periodic materials must exist and altered its definition to the broader "any solid having an essentially discrete diffraction diagram".  Meaning that the substance is ordered but may not have translational symmetry.  Quasicrystals remained as mysterious as ever.  By his collaboraters, Dan Shechtman was urged to dig deeper. </aside>

		<aside class='notes'> The two tiles are called a kite and dart.  When given special markings, they will only tile the plane aperiodically.  They have the property that any finite pattern in the tiling occurs infinitely often throughout the tiling.  Notice that some of the patterns within the tiling have a distinct five fold star rotational symmetry.  Wherever there is a five, the golden ratio closely follows.  There are many instances of the golden ratio appearing within the tiling, once such instance is in the frequency of kite to dart tiles.  The number of kite to dart tiles in a finite pattern within the tiling is given by Fibonacci numbers and so approximates the golden ratio.

Here is a picture of the facade of a TransBay Railroad center in San Francisco.   There was even toilet paper made.  Unfortunately, Roger Penrose has a patent on the tiling so he sued Kleenex for making it.   </aside>

		1983 Paul Steinhardt and his student Don Levine were inspired by the Penrose tiling and created a theory on a new kind of matter. <br>
				 "Quasicrystals: A New Class of Ordered Structures."
		<img src="public/images/paulsteinhardt.jpg" height = '50%' width ='50%'> 
		<aside class='notes'> Paul Steinhardt astrophysicist, surmised that it was possible to be able to have a crystal tile space aperiodically. Where the penrose tiling is an example of an aperiodic tiling of the plane. Quasicrystals are models of aperiodic tilings of three dimensional space.   <br>
				The new theory overturned 200 years of scientific dogma.   By changing the set of assumptions, quasicrstals went against all of the previously accepted mathematical theorems about the symmetry of matter. Symmetries once thought to be forbidden for solids are actually possible for quasicrystals, including solids with axes of five-fold symmetry.  Even more surprisingly, this paper was published a year after Dan Shechtman's discovery and the two researchers were working in the same state.   Steinhardt and Levine were shown a preprint of the Shechtman team's paper and immediately recognized that it could be experimental proof of their still-unpublished quasicrystal theory. </aside>

		You would think that with these two papers accepted that the alloy Dan Shechtman found would be believed and he would be redeemed for the great research he is. But no.  Both papers were accepted with a lot of doubt.  Many theories came about to explain Dan Shechtman's discovery as a mistake.  Each counter-theory that came about was disproved but sketicism remained. Dan Shechtman discvered an alloy, but it was believed that nature would never construct such a thing. Paul and Dan spent the next 26 years convincing the scientific community that a natural quasicrystal was possible.  A little bit before 2009, Paul got lucky.  He was contacted by a researcher from Italy with a sample of a rock whose diffraction pattern had five fold symmetry.  Paul could not idenfity the origin and formation and the sample was very small.  He sent it to several experts with very disappointing answers, the rock was believed to be slag or waste matter from refining metal.  He decided to take the matter into his own hands, he and a team travelled to the barren arctic tundra in Russia, on an expedition to find another piece of this rock that could be more clearly identified.
